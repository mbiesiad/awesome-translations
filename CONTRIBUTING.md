## Updating your PR

A lot of times, making a PR adhere to the standards above can be difficult.
If the maintainers notice anything that we'd like changed, we'll ask you to
edit your PR before we merge it. There's no need to open a new PR, just edit
the existing one. If you're not sure how to do that,
[here is a guide](https://github.com/RichardLitt/knowledge/blob/master/github/amending-a-commit-guide.md)
on the different ways you can update your PR so that we can merge it.


## TODO:
:white_check_mark: Good to see - languages versions.

:white_check_mark: More awesome resources.

:white_check_mark: Sort alphabetically (ie. Zooniverse' projects)

## Translations

For translations please make other branch for your changes & before PR (ie. for Spain will be: es_ES etc).

See here (example): [awesome-astronomy](https://github.com/mbiesiad/awesome-astronomy) and here: [awesome-astronomy-pl_PL](https://github.com/mbiesiad/awesome-astronomy/tree/pl_PL)

If you want, you can also add 'Translated by:' (ie. @JohnSmith) with link to your GitHub account or Twitter handle. Thank you!
